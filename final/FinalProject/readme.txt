Should I buy the Car?

This program is based on New Zealand conditions

This program provides helpful financial information to help make 2 decisions.

There are other factors that cannot be quantified as numbers that are also important to this decision.

1. If the car I want is on sale should I ignore the sale and continue to save or use my savings as a deposit and get a loan for the rest?
    This program makes some assumptions
    - the tradin value of your current car will be worth half the amount it is today buy the time you have finished saving.
    - The cost of diesel vs petrol is ignored
    - The clean car discount is $3700 - this seems about the average amount
    - The ute tax is $3000 - this seems about the average amount
    - The standard rates and fees for the loan and savings accounts are the current ones offered by my bank.

    The results of this question show the out of pocket costs for both options
    Out of pocket costs are:
    - loan repayments
    - deposit
    - amounts saved (but not the interest recieved as this was provided by the bank)
    - extra costs of keeping the current car that you would not have with the new car.

2. Will buying an electric or hybrid car save me money?
    This program compares the yearly costs of owning both cars - it does not include depreciation 
    It looks at differences in petrol, insurance and repair costs. It also looks at loan repayments and / or interest lost because you have less money in your savings account.
